# Open Data Day 2022 - Paris
For the Open Data Day 2022 the local chapter of CorrelAid in Paris [organized a hackathon](https://events.cri-paris.org/e/96/open-data-day-hackathon-paris-in-numbers) at [Learning Planet Institute](https://www.learningplanetinstitute.org/en). Under the topic "Paris in Numbers" the participants worked on a challenge suggested by the City of Paris - "Mission vélo".

## The challenge
The City of Paris' innovation office and mobility agency kindly shared with us a real-world challenge: Increasing the offer of bike parking spots in Paris ("Mission Vélo"). They would like to base their decisions on data, to create efficient and relevant results. They shared with us some directions they identified so far to visualize the existing situation, identify the main facilities and businesses that don't have bicycle parking in immediate vicinity, the usage of vélib (rental bikes), to just name a few.

__They also suggested us a range of open datasets, for example:__
* Availability of vélib bikes : https://opendata.paris.fr/explore/dataset/velib-disponibilite-en-temps-reel/
* Localisation of vélib stations : https://opendata.paris.fr/explore/dataset/velib-emplacement-des-stations/
* Bike counting : https://opendata.paris.fr/explore/dataset/comptage-velo-donnees-compteurs/
* Temporary bike lanes : https://opendata.paris.fr/explore/dataset/deconfinement-pistes-cyclables-temporaires/
* A list of datasets that correspond to the search « velo + espace public » (bike and public space) : https://opendata.paris.fr/explore/?disjunctive.theme&disjunctive.publisher&disjunctive.keyword&disjunctive.modified&disjunctive.features&sort=modified&q=v%C3%A9lo&refine.theme=Mobilit%C3%A9+et+Espace+Public
